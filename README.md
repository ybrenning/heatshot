# Visualizing NBA shooting tendencies

This repo contains a project built for the course 'Visuelle Textanalyse' at the University of Leipzig.

The project consists of data acquisition, formatting and visualization. The data was scraped from [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) using `BeautifulSoup`. 

The visualization takes place within a Dash app and mainly consists of a shot chart heatmap, creating using [Kernel Density Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation).

This project only uses data from the 2023-2024 NBA season, mainly due to time constraints.
